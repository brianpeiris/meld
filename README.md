# meld

Meld wants to be a collaborative tool for building with WebXR experiences in a playful, exploratory fashion.  
Eventually it might take the form of a networked, asymmetric editor where a coder codes on a PC while a playtester plays in VR.  
Meld uses an API inspired by P5.js but is built on top of three.js. See [example.ts](src/example.ts).  
It is very much a work in progress.
